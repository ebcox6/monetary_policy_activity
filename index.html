        <h1>Central Bank Simulation Challenge</h1>
    </header>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this activity is to understand how central banks use monetary policy to stabilize the economy. You will be taking on the role of a central bank and making decisions based on real-world economic scenarios. By the end of the activity, you should be able to evaluate how interest rates impact inflation, unemployment, and overall economic growth.</p>

        <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
        <h3>1. Form Your Central Bank Group</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You will work in groups of 3-4 students.</li>
            <li>Each group will act as the central bank of a fictional country.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Understand Your Scenario</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You will receive a scenario card that describes your country's current economic situation. For example, your scenario card might state: "Inflation is currently at 7%, GDP growth has slowed, and unemployment is rising." This will help you understand what kind of information to expect.</li>
            <li>Make sure to note key indicators: <strong>inflation rate, GDP growth, unemployment rate</strong>, and <strong>current interest rate</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Assess Economic Conditions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Analyze the economic situation of your country. Discuss the potential <strong>risks</strong> and <strong>returns</strong> associated with changing the interest rate.</li>
            <li>Consider how changing the interest rate would impact <strong>borrowing, spending, and saving</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Make a Monetary Policy Decision</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Decide if your central bank will <strong>increase, decrease, or keep the interest rate unchanged</strong>.</li>
            <li>Use concepts like <strong>interest rates, inflation, unemployment</strong>, and <strong>economic growth</strong> to support your decision.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Prepare Your Policy Presentation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>As a group, create a brief presentation (3-5 minutes) explaining your decision.</li>
            <li>Make sure to answer:
                <ul>
                    <li>What economic indicators influenced your decision?</li>
                    <li>What risks are involved in your policy choice?</li>
                    <li>How do you predict your decision will impact the economy?</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6. Present and Reflect</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Present your decision to the rest of the class.</li>
            <li>Be ready to explain why you chose your specific policy and respond to questions from your classmates.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>7. Money Market Graph Activity</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Illustrate how your decision affects the <strong>money market</strong> using a graph.</li>
            <li>Label <strong>interest rates, money supply, and bond prices</strong>. Be sure to describe any shifts caused by your policy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Concepts to Include</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Interest Rates:</strong> The cost of borrowing money, which can be influenced by central bank policies.</li>
            <li><strong>Inflation:</strong> The rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services rises.</li>
            <li><strong>Economic Growth:</strong> Measured by GDP, indicating how well an economy is performing.</li>
            <li><strong>Unemployment:</strong> The percentage of the labor force that is without work but actively seeking employment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Questions to Consider</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>How does changing the interest rate affect <strong>consumer spending</strong> and <strong>business investment</strong>?</li>
            <li>What are the potential <strong>trade-offs</strong> between reducing inflation and maintaining employment?</li>
            <li>How does your decision impact <strong>foreign exchange rates</strong> and <strong>international trade</strong>?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>After all groups have presented, take notes on the differences between each central bank's decision. Consider the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What were the different approaches taken by each group?</li>
            <li>Were there any unintended consequences of the policies?</li>
            <li>How do interest rates connect with broader economic stability?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final Notes</h2>
        <p>Work collaboratively and ensure all members contribute to the discussion. Be prepared to answer questions from other groups, as this will help deepen your understanding of monetary policy.</p>

        <p>Good luck, central bankers! Remember, your decisions will shape the future of your countryâ€™s economy.</p>
